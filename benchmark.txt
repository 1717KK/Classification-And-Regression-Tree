In general, using SQL to build classification tree is much lower than using data frame like numpy. The algorithm needs to loop each feature and each sample. In SQL version, getting data of each feature asks the code to access the database once. Besides, the number of comparison of one features will be n-1 if there are n samples and data are continuous, which also asks the code to access the database. Therefore, a large number of access causes the slow speed of building SQL tree.
